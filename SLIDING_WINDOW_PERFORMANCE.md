# Sliding Window MODWT Performance Results

## Implementation Summary

We successfully implemented a fully optimized sliding window MODWT with the following components:

### 1. **Basic Infrastructure (SlidingMODWT)**
- Sliding window detection (left/right shifts)
- Filter normalization and caching
- Affected boundary calculation
- Falls back to full computation for correctness

### 2. **Enhanced Version (EnhancedSlidingMODWT)**
- Caching support infrastructure
- Optimization statistics and analysis
- Framework for future enhancements

### 3. **Optimized Implementation (OptimizedSlidingMODWT)**
- Full caching of intermediate V_j coefficients
- Partial boundary updates only
- Cascading dependency management
- Optimized circular convolution

## Performance Results

### Current Speedup: **6.2x**

From the test results:
```
Standard time: 39,413,042 ns
Optimized time: 6,338,583 ns
Speedup: 6.217957862190966x
```

For individual sliding window updates:
```
First computation: 11,777,666 ns
Second computation (optimized): 1,721,375 ns
Optimization ratio: 6.84x
```

### Performance Characteristics

1. **First computation**: Full MODWT with caching (~12ms for 1024 samples)
2. **Subsequent sliding windows**: Optimized updates (~1.7ms)
3. **Speedup**: 6-7x for sliding windows
4. **Memory overhead**: Minimal (caching V_j coefficients)

## Technical Implementation

### Key Optimizations

1. **Filter Caching**
   - Upsampled filters cached per level
   - Avoids repeated upsampling operations

2. **Intermediate Coefficient Caching**
   - V_j (approximation) coefficients stored
   - Enables partial updates at each level

3. **Boundary-Only Updates**
   - Only affected coefficients recomputed
   - Affected size: (2^(j-1)) * L coefficients at level j

4. **Optimized Convolution**
   - Skip zero coefficients in sparse filters
   - Modulo optimization for small filters

### Algorithm Flow

1. **Initial computation**: Full MODWT with V_j caching
2. **Sliding detection**: Verify left/right shift by 1
3. **Partial update**: 
   - Update V_0 with new data
   - For each level j:
     - Update only boundary W_j and V_j
     - Propagate changes to next level
4. **Cache update**: Store new state for next iteration

## Use Cases

This optimization is ideal for:
- Real-time signal processing
- Streaming data analysis
- Online anomaly detection
- Continuous wavelet monitoring
- High-frequency trading signals

## Limitations

1. **Memory**: Requires caching V_j coefficients
2. **Initialization**: First computation is not optimized
3. **Shift constraint**: Only works for single-position shifts
4. **Numerical precision**: Small differences in edge cases

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-position shifts**: Support shifts > 1
2. **Adaptive caching**: Smart memory management
3. **GPU acceleration**: Parallel boundary updates
4. **Streaming API**: Native streaming interface

## Conclusion

The optimized sliding window MODWT achieves a solid **6.2x speedup** over standard MODWT for sliding windows. This makes it practical for real-time applications where data arrives continuously and only boundary coefficients need updating. The implementation provides a good balance between performance and correctness while maintaining the mathematical properties of the MODWT.
