/**
 * Meyer wavelet implementation for Continuous Wavelet Transform.
 * 
 * The Meyer wavelet is defined in the frequency domain and has compact support
 * in frequency. It is infinitely differentiable and has excellent frequency
 * localization properties.
 * 
 * The Meyer wavelet is defined through its Fourier transform:
 * Ψ(ω) = sin(π/2 * ν(3|ω|/(2π) - 1)) * exp(iω/2)  for 2π/3 < |ω| < 4π/3
 * Ψ(ω) = cos(π/2 * ν(3|ω|/(4π) - 1)) * exp(iω/2)  for 4π/3 < |ω| < 8π/3
 * Ψ(ω) = 0                                         otherwise
 * 
 * where ν is a smooth transition function satisfying:
 * ν(x) = 0 for x ≤ 0
 * ν(x) = 1 for x ≥ 1
 * ν(x) + ν(1-x) = 1
 * 
 * Key properties:
 * - Defined in frequency domain
 * - Compact support in frequency
 * - Infinitely differentiable
 * - Orthogonal
 * - Real-valued in time domain
 * - Excellent frequency localization
